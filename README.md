#### This project our team try to implement some parameter of Quality of Experience (QoE) in Mobile Network  

In this project we tried to show QoE parameter in different generation of Mobile Network (ie. 2G, 3G, 4G) because these parameters have some different from one generation to the other.

Below you are able to watch the over all of our task which we have done so far as a gif

In this project we are using fallback method which means because in the area we have traveled to evaluate our app, there was no 3G technology, we called each other to fallback and show the functionality of the app as you can see as a screenshot below.
